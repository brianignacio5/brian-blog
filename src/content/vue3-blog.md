# Writing a Vue 3 + TypeScript blog

The following is a recording of how to implement a blog using markdown files using github pages, vue 3 and typescript.

The App.vue has a header with `router-link` links to each of the views directory. vue-router is used to render each page within the `router-view` in App.

The Posts view shows all the posts found in the **src/content** directory.

The Post view shows the article. It include date, tags, title, description and content from the **BlogPost** object. The route is generated by the slug field.

The Home view shows the latest 3 posts from the post list and popular tags. It will use the `src/services/blogService.ts` to obtain the articles from **src/content**

```ts
const blogService = BlogService.getInstance();
const loading = ref(true);

const recentPosts = computed(() => {
  return blogService.getAllPostsMeta().slice(0, 3);
});

const popularTags = computed(() => {
  return blogService.getAllTags().slice(0, 6);
});
```

The blogService will use the `import.meta.glob` to import all markdown files with **'../content/*.md'** glob pattern and later in the loadPosts it will populate the lists of posts and post metadata using the `markdownLoader.ts` and sorting the articles by date.

The markdownLoader.ts uses the [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) package to parse the metadata of markdown file and separate the content.

For example:

```
---
title: Hello
slug: home
---
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

turns into 

```ts
{
  content: '<h1>Hello world!</h1>',
  data: { 
    title: 'Hello', 
    slug: 'home' 
  }
}
```

After that the [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) npm package to parse the content into html.

Results are stored into into a **BlogPostMeta** object and into a **BlogPost** object.
